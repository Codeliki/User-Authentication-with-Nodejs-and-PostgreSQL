ðŸ’« User Authentication with NodeJS and PostgreSQL. 

In this project I've used: 
-- Express- To serve the application 
-- bcrypt- To hash user password to make them secure
-- Express-session- To store session details in a session cookie object
-- Express-flash- To display flash messages to the user
-- Passport- To authenticate users
-- Passport-Local- To implement a local authentication strategy for our application.
